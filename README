# Installation

## Prerequisite
This was tested and developed on Ubuntu, though as long as you can install and use Docker, and (optionally)
install and use Gazebo 9, it should work.

This means that theoretically you can run Docker in Linux subsystem for Windows and compile Gazebo 9
youself on Windows, but I wouldn't recommend it.

The docker image 

## Install Docker

Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) to install Docker.

## (Optional) Install Gazebo 9
Follow the instructions [here](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?cat=install).

# Usage
## Build the image
```
docker build . -t swarm
```

## Run the container
Run the container as a daemon in the background, mounting the logs folder to /tmp/.gazebo/:
```
docker run -d -v="/tmp/.gazebo/:/root/.gazebo/" --name=swarm-app swarm
```

## Get the container IP
docker inspect --format '{{ .NetworkSettings.IPAddress }}' swarm-app

## Stop and re-run the container
Whenever you build a new image, you must first stop the existing container:
```
docker stop swarm-app
```
Then remove the container:
```
docker rm swarm-app
```
Now you can run the image in a new container of the same name.

## Log into the container
You can log into the running container by running:
```
docker exec -it swarm-app bash
```

## (Optional) Run the gazebo client locally
If you install Gazbo 9, you can connect to the gzserver inside the container using gzclient GUI
by setting the address of the master URI to the container's public address.
```
export GAZEBO_MASTER_IP=$(docker inspect --format '{{ .NetworkSettings.IPAddress }}' swarm-app)
export GAZEBO_MASTER_URI=$GAZEBO_MASTER_IP:11345
gzclient --verbose
```
